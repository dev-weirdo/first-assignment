          Whenever you want to achieve something, keep your eyes open,
          concentrate and make sure you know exactly what it is you want. No one
          can hit their target with their eyes closed.

          It is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree — make
          sure you understand the fundamental principles, i.e. the trunk and big
          branches, before you get into the leaves or there is nothing for them
          to hang on to.

          One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to
          welcome and help people in a way we couldn’t as individuals. When we
          pool our strength and share the work and responsibility, we can
          welcome many people, even those in deep distress, and perhaps help
          them find self-confidence and inner healing.
